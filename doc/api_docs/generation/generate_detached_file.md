## Response Attributes
If the file has not finished generating when this returns, further checks for whether the generation is complete or not should be done using [check\_detached\_generation\_status](./check_detached_generation_status.md).

- `job_id`: (integer) job ID of the generation job in question
- `status`: (string) indicates the file's status. Possible values are:
    - `finished`: file has been generated and is available for download
    - `waiting`: file has either not started/finished generating or has finished generating but is not yet uploaded to S3
    - `failed`: an error occurred and the file generation or S3 upload failed, the generated file is invalid, or any other error
    - `invalid`: no generation request has ever been made for this submission ID before
- `file_type`: (string) indicates the file that the status data refers to. Possible values are:
    - `D1`
    - `D2`
    - `A`
    - `BOC`
- `url`: (string) a signed S3 URL from which the generated file can be downloaded. This will be the string `"#"` if the file is not in the `finished` state.
- `size`: (integer) the size of the generated file in bytes
- `start`: (string) the file start date, in `MM/DD/YYYY` format. If not a D1/D2 file, this key will not be returned.
- `end`: (string) the file end date, in `MM/DD/YYYY` format. If not a D1/D2 file, this key will not be returned.
- `message`: (string) a user-readable error message when the file is `failed`, otherwise returns a blank string
