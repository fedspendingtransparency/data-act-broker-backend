# POST "/v1/upload\_dabs\_files/"
A call to this route should be of content type `"multipart/form-data"`, and, if using curl or a similar service, should use @ notation for the values of the "appropriations", "program\_activity" and "award\_financial" keys, to indicate the local path to the files to be uploaded. Otherwise, should pass a file-like object.

This route will upload the files, then kick off the validation jobs. It will return the submission\_id.

For a new submission, only files B and C must be submitted. If file A is submitted for a new submission, it will be ignored but will not cause an error. For corrections to an existing submission, one or more files must be submitted along with the `existing_submission_id` parameter. Custom file A may be submitted for an existing submission.

For information on the CGAC and FREC parameters, see the note in the main README in the "[Background](../../README.md#background)" section.
