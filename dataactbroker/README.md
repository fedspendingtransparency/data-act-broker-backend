# The DATA Act Broker Application Programming Interface (API)

The DATA Act Broker API powers the DATA Act's data submission process.

## Background

The U.S. Department of the Treasury is building a suite of open-source tools to help federal agencies comply with the [DATA Act](http://fedspendingtransparency.github.io/about/ "Federal Spending Transparency Background") and to deliver the resulting standardized federal spending information back to agencies and to the public.

For more information about the DATA Act Broker codebase, please visit this repository's [main README](../README.md "DATA Act Broker Backend README").

## Broker API Project Layout

The Broker API has two major directories: scripts and handlers.

```
dataactbroker/
├── scripts/        (Install and setup scripts)
└── handlers/       (Route handlers)
```

### Scripts
The `/dataactbroker/scripts` folder contains the install scripts needed to setup the broker API for a local install. For complete instructions on running your own copy of the API and other DATA Act broker components, please refer to the [documentation in the DATA Act core responsitory](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-broker-backend/blob/master/doc/INSTALL.md "DATA Act broker installation guide").

### Handlers
The `dataactbroker/handlers` folder contains the logic to handle requests that are dispatched from the `loginRoutes.py`, `fileRoutes.py`, and 'userRoutes.py' files. Routes defined in these files may include the `@permissions_check` tag to the route definition. This tag adds a wrapper that checks if there exists a session for the current user and if the user is logged in, as well as checking the user's permissions to determine if the user has access to this route. If user is not logged in to the system or does not have access to the route, a 401 HTTP error will be returned. This tag is defined in `dataactbroker/permissions.py`.

`accountHandler.py` contains the functions to check logins and to log users out.

`fileHandler.py` contains functions for managing user file interaction. It creates all of the jobs that are part of the user submission and has query methods to get the status of a submission. In addition, this class creates downloadable links to error reports created by the DATA Act Validator.

In addition to these helper objects, the following sub classes also exist within the directory: `UserHandler`, `JobHandler`, `ErrorHandler`, and 'InterfaceHolder'. These classes extend the database connection objects that are located in the DATA Act Core. Extra query methods exist in these classes that are used exclusively by the Broker API.

## DATA Act Broker Route Documentation

All routes that require a login should now be passed a header "x-session-id".  The value for this header should be taken
from the login route response header "x-session-id".

### Status Codes
In general, status codes returned are as follows:

* 200 if successful
* 400 if the request is malformed
* 401 if the username or password are incorrect, or the session has expired
* 500 for server-side errors

### GET "/"
This route confirms that the broker is running

Example input:

None

Example output:

"Broker is running"

### User Routes

#### POST "/v1/login/"

}
```

Example output:

```json

After a successful submission this route will require
`confirm_email_token` to be called again.

```

#### POST "/v1/confirm_email_token/"
Checks the token sent by email.  If successful, updates the user to email_confirmed.  A call to this route should have JSON or form-urlencoded with key "token". If the token is invalid a failure message is returned along with the error code. The email address will also be returned upon success.

### File Routes

#### GET "/"
This route confirms that the broker is running

Example input: None
Example output: "Broker is running"

#### GET "/<filename>"
This path will return files located in the local folder. This path is only accessible for local installs due
to security reasons.

Example Route `/Users/serverdata/test.csv`  for example will return the `test.csv` if the local folder points
to `/Users/serverdata`.

#### POST "/v1/local_upload/"
Input for this route should be a post form with the key of `file` where the uploaded file is located. This route **only** will
return a success for local installs for security reasons. Upon successful upload, file path will be returned.

Example Output:
```json
{
   "path": "/User/localuser/server/1234_filename.csv"
}
```

#### POST "/v1/submit_files/"
This route is used to retrieve S3 URLs to upload files. Data should be JSON with keys: ["appropriations", "award\_financial", "award", "program\_activity"], each with a filename as a value, and submission metadata keys: ["agency_name","reporting_period_start_date","reporting_period_end_date","is_quarter","existing_submission_id"].  If an existing submission ID is provided, all other keys are optional and any data provided will be used to correct information in the existing submission.

This route will also add jobs to the job tracker DB and return conflict free S3 URLs for uploading. Each key put in the request comes back with an url_key containing the S3 URL and a key\_id containing the job id. A returning submission\_id will also exist which acts as identifier for the submission.

A credentials object is also part of the returning request. This object provides temporarily access to upload S3 Files using an AWS SDK. It contains the following: SecretAccessKey, SessionToken, Expiration, and AccessKeyId.
It is important to note that the role used to create the credentials should be limited to just S3 access.

When upload is complete, the finalize\_submission route should be called with the job\_id.

Example input:

```json
{
  "appropriations":"appropriations.csv",
  "award_financial":"award_financial.csv",
  "award":"award.csv",
  "program_activity":"program_activity.csv",
  "agency_name":"Name of the agency",
  "reporting_period_start_date":"03/31/2016",
  "reporting_period_end_date":"03/31/2016",
  "is_quarter":False,
  "existing_submission_id: 7 (leave out if not correcting an existing submission)
}
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "submission_id": 12345,

  "bucket_name": "S3-bucket",

  "award_id": 100,
  "award_key": "2/1453474323_awards.csv",

  "appropriations_id": 101,
  "appropriations_key": "2/1453474324_appropriations.csv",

  "award_financial_id": 102,
  "award_financial_key": "2/1453474327_award_financial.csv",

  "program_activity_id": 103,
  "program_activity_key": "2/1453474333_program_activity.csv",

    "SessionToken": "ABCDEFG",
    "Expiration": "2016-01-22T15:25:23Z",
    "AccessKeyId": "ABCDEFG"
  }
}
```

#### POST "/v1/finalize_job/"
A call to this route should have JSON or form-urlencoded with a key of "upload\_id" and value of the job id received from the submit_files route. This will change the status of the upload job to finished so that dependent jobs can be started.

Example input:

```json
{
  "upload_id":3011
}
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```
#### POST "/v1/submission\_error_reports/"
A call to this route should have JSON or form-urlencoded with a key of "submission\_id" and value of the submission id received from the submit\_files route.  The response object will be JSON with keys of "job\_X\_error\_url" for each job X that is part of the submission, and the value will be the signed URL of the error report on S3. Note that for failed jobs (i.e. file-level errors), no error reports will be created.

Example input:

```json
{
   "submission_id":1610
}
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "job_3012_error_url": "https...",
  "job_3006_error_url": "https...",
  "job_3010_error_url": "https...",
  "job_3008_error_url": "https..."
}
```

#### POST "/v1/check_status/"
A call to this route will provide status information on all jobs associated with the specified submission.  The request should have JSON or form-urlencoded with a key "submission\_id".  The response will contain a list of status objects for each job under the key "jobs", and other submission-level data.

Example input:

```json
{
  "submission_id":1610
}
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "jobs": [
    {

## Test Cases

To run the broker API unit tests, navigate to the project's test folder (`data-act-broker-backend/tests`) and type the following:

        $ python runTests.py

To generate a test coverage report from the command line:

1. Make sure you're in the project's test folder (`data-act-broker-backend/tests`).
2. Run the tests using the `coverage` command: `coverage run runTests.py`.
3. After the tests are done running, view the coverage report by typing `coverage report`. To exclude third-party libraries from the report, you can tell it to ignore the `site-packages` folder: `coverage report --omit=*/site-packages*`.
