# The DATA Act Broker Application Programming Interface (API)

The DATA Act Broker API powers the DATA Act's data submission process.

## Background

The U.S. Department of the Treasury is building a suite of open-source tools to help federal agencies comply with the [DATA Act](http://fedspendingtransparency.github.io/about/ "Federal Spending Transparency Background") and to deliver the resulting standardized federal spending information back to agencies and to the public.

For more information about the DATA Act Broker codebase, please visit this repository's [main README](../README.md "DATA Act Broker Backend README").

## Broker API Project Layout

The Broker API has two major directories: scripts and handlers.

```
dataactbroker/
├── scripts/        (Install and setup scripts)
└── handlers/       (Route handlers)
```

### Scripts
The `/dataactbroker/scripts` folder contains the install scripts needed to setup the broker API for a local install. For complete instructions on running your own copy of the API and other DATA Act broker components, please refer to the [documentation in the DATA Act core responsitory](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-broker-backend/blob/master/doc/INSTALL.md "DATA Act broker installation guide").

### Handlers
The `dataactbroker/handlers` folder contains the logic to handle requests that are dispatched from the `loginRoutes.py`, `fileRoutes.py`, and 'userRoutes.py' files. Routes defined in these files may include the `@requires_login` and `@requires_submission_perms` tags to the route definition. This tag adds a wrapper that checks if there exists a session for the current user and if the user is logged in, as well as checking the user's permissions to determine if the user has access to this route. If user is not logged in to the system or does not have access to the route, a 401 HTTP error will be returned. This tags are defined in `dataactbroker/permissions.py`.

`accountHandler.py` contains the functions to check logins and to log users out.

`fileHandler.py` contains functions for managing user file interaction. It creates all of the jobs that are part of the user submission and has query methods to get the status of a submission. In addition, this class creates downloadable links to error reports created by the DATA Act Validator.

## DATA Act Broker Route Documentation

All routes that require a login should now be passed a header "x-session-id".  The value for this header should be taken
from the login route response header "x-session-id".

### Status Codes
In general, status codes returned are as follows:

* 200 if successful
* 400 if the request is malformed
* 401 if the username or password are incorrect, or the session has expired
* 500 for server-side errors

### GET "/"
This route confirms that the broker is running

Example input:

None

Example output:

"Broker is running"

### User Routes

#### POST "/v1/max_login/"
This route sends a request to the backend with the ticket obtained from the MAX login endpoint in order to verify authentication and access to the Data Broker.

#### Body (JSON)

```
{
    "ticket": ST-123456-abcdefghijklmnopqrst-login.max.gov,
    "service": http%3A%2F%2Furl.encoded.requesting.url%2F
}
```

#### Body Description

* `ticket` - ticket string received from MAX from initial login request (pending validation)
* `service` - URL encoded string that is the source of the initial login request

#### Response (JSON)
Response will be somewhat similar to the original `/login` endpoint. More data will be added to the response depending on what we get back from MAX upon validating the ticket.

```
{
    "message": "Login successful",
    "user_id": 42,
    "name": "John",
    "title":"Developer",
    "agency": "Department of Labor",
    "permission" : 1
}
```

#### POST "/v1/login/"
This route checks the username and password against a credentials file. Accepts input as json or form-urlencoded, with keys "username" and "password". See `current_user` docs for details.

Example input:

```json
{
    "username": "user",
    "password": "pass"
}
```

Example output:

```json
{
    "message": "Login successful",
    "user_id": 42,
    "name": "Jill",
    "title":"Developer",
    "skip_guide": False,
    "website_admin": False,
    "affiliations": [
        {"agency_name": "Department of Labor", "permission": "writer"}
    ]
}
```

#### POST "/v1/logout/"
Logs the current user out, only the login route will be accessible until the next login.  If not logged in, just stays logged out. Returns 200 in both cases.

Example input:

None

Example output:

```json
{
    "message": "Logout successful"
}
```

#### GET "/v1/session/"
Checks that the session is still valid. Returns 200, and JSON with key "status" containing True if the session exists, and False if it doesn't.

Example input:

None

Example output:

```json
{
    "status": "True"
}
```

#### GET "/v1/current_user/"
Gets the information of the current that is login to the system.

Example input:

None

Example output:

```json
{
    "user_id": 42,
    "name": "John",
    "title":"Developer",
    "skip_guide": False,
    "website_admin": False,
    "affiliations": [
        {"agency_name": "Department of Labor", "permission": "writer"}
    ]
}
}
```

* `skip_guide` indicates whether or not the user has requested to skip introductory materials.
* `website_admin` describes a super-user status.
* `affiliations` is a list of objects indicating which agencies this user is a part of and what permissions they have at that agency.


#### POST "/v1/set_skip_guide/"
Sets skip_guide parameter for current user, which controls whether the submission guide should be displayed.  A call to this route should have JSON or form-urlencoded with key "skip_guide", value should be either true or false.

Example input:

```json
{
   "skip_guide": True
}
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "message": "skip_guide set successfully",
  "skip_guide": True
}
```

### File Routes

#### GET "/"
This route confirms that the broker is running

Example input: None
Example output: "Broker is running"

#### GET "/\<filename\>"
This path will return files located in the local folder. This path is only accessible for local installs due
to security reasons.

Example Route `/Users/serverdata/test.csv`  for example will return the `test.csv` if the local folder points
to `/Users/serverdata`.

#### POST "/v1/local_upload/"
Input for this route should be a post form with the key of `file` where the uploaded file is located. This route **only** will
return a success for local installs for security reasons. Upon successful upload, file path will be returned.

Example Output:
```json
{
   "path": "/User/localuser/server/1234_filename.csv"
}
```

#### POST "/v1/submit_files/"
This route is used to retrieve S3 URLs to upload files. Data should be JSON with keys: ["appropriations", "award_financial", "award", "program_activity"], each with a filename as a value, and submission metadata keys: ["agency_name","reporting_period_start_date","reporting_period_end_date","is_quarter","existing_submission_id"].  If an existing submission ID is provided, all other keys are optional and any data provided will be used to correct information in the existing submission.

This route will also add jobs to the job tracker DB and return conflict free S3 URLs for uploading. Each key put in the request comes back with an url_key containing the S3 URL and a key_id containing the job id. A returning submission_id will also exist which acts as identifier for the submission.

A credentials object is also part of the returning request. This object provides temporarily access to upload S3 Files using an AWS SDK. It contains the following: SecretAccessKey, SessionToken, Expiration, and AccessKeyId.
It is important to note that the role used to create the credentials should be limited to just S3 access.

When upload is complete, the finalize_submission route should be called with the job_id.

Example input:

```json
{
  "appropriations":"appropriations.csv",
  "award_financial":"award_financial.csv",
  "award":"award.csv",
  "program_activity":"program_activity.csv",
  "agency_name":"Name of the agency",
  "reporting_period_start_date":"03/31/2016",
  "reporting_period_end_date":"03/31/2016",
  "is_quarter":False,
  "existing_submission_id: 7 (leave out if not correcting an existing submission)
}
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "submission_id": 12345,

    "AccessKeyId": "ABCDEFG"
  }
}
```

#### POST "/v1/finalize_job/"
A call to this route should have JSON or form-urlencoded with a key of "upload_id" and value of the job id received from the submit_files route. This will change the status of the upload job to finished so that dependent jobs can be started.

Example input:

```json
{
  "upload_id":3011
}
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

#### POST "/v1/submission_error_reports/"
A call to this route should have JSON or form-urlencoded with a key of "submission_id" and value of the submission id received from the submit_files route.  The response object will be JSON with keys of "job_X_error_url" for each job X that is part of the submission, and the value will be the signed URL of the error report on S3. Note that for failed jobs (i.e. file-level errors), no error reports will be created.

Example input:

```json

## File Generation Routes

#### GET "/v1/list_submissions/"
List submissions for all agencies for which the current user is a member of. Optional query parameters are `?page=[page #]&limit=[limit #]&certified=[true|false]` which correspond to the current page number and how many submissions to return per page (limit). If the query parameters are not present, the default is `page=1`, `limit=5` and if `certified` is not provided, all submissions will be returned containing a mix of the two.

##### Example input:

`/v1/list_submissions?page=1&limit=2

##### Example output:

"total" is the total number of submissions available for that user.

## Test Cases

### Integration Tests

To run the broker API integration tests, navigate to the project's test folder (`data-act-broker-backend/tests`) and type the following:

        $ python integration/runTests.py

To generate a test coverage report from the command line:

1. Make sure you're in the project's test folder (`data-act-broker-backend/tests`).
2. Run the tests using the `coverage` command: `coverage run integration/runTests.py`.
3. After the tests are done running, view the coverage report by typing `coverage report`. To exclude third-party libraries from the report, you can tell it to ignore the `site-packages` folder: `coverage report --omit=*/site-packages*`.

## D File Callback
