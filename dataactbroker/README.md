# The DATA Act Broker Application Programming Interface (API)

The DATA Act Broker API powers the DATA Act's data submission process.

## Background

The U.S. Department of the Treasury is building a suite of open-source tools to help federal agencies comply with the [DATA Act](http://fedspendingtransparency.github.io/about/ "Federal Spending Transparency Background") and to deliver the resulting standardized federal spending information back to agencies and to the public.

For more information about the DATA Act Broker codebase, please visit this repository's [main README](../README.md "DATA Act Broker Backend README").

**A Note on CGAC/FREC**: In the vast majority of cases, top-level agencies identify themselves for purposes of DABS submissions or detached D1/D2 file generation by their 3-digit CGAC code. CGAC are issued and managed by OMB and are updated yearly in the A-11 circular appendix C. The CGAC is equivalent to the treasury concept of the Agency Identifier (AID) embedded in all Treasury Account Symbols (TAS).

In a few cases, legitimately separate (at least for financial reporting purposes) agencies share a CGAC. To allow them to report as separate entities in the DATA Act Broker, we leveraged an internal Treasury element called the Financial Reporting Entity Code (FREC) that Treasury already uses to distinguish between these agencies with shared AID at the TAS level. This field comes from Treasury's CARS system.
These agencies, listed in the table below, should use this four-digit FREC code for purposes of identifying themselves in DABS instead of the CGAC they share with one or more agencies.
The following is the complete list of agencies supported under the FREC paradigm in DABS. These agencies should always identify themselves to the Broker with the 4-digit FREC code instead of the 3 digit CGAC they share with other agencies.

## Broker API Project Layout

The Broker API has two major directories: scripts and handlers.

```
dataactbroker/
├── scripts/        (Install and setup scripts)
└── handlers/       (Route handlers)
```

### Scripts
The `/dataactbroker/scripts` folder contains the install scripts needed to setup the broker API for a local install. For complete instructions on running your own copy of the API and other DATA Act broker components, please refer to the [documentation in the DATA Act core responsitory](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-broker-backend/blob/master/doc/INSTALL.md "DATA Act broker installation guide").

### Handlers
The `dataactbroker/handlers` folder contains the logic to handle requests that are dispatched from the `domain_routes.py`, `file_routes.py`, `login_routes.py`, and `user_routes.py` files. Routes defined in these files may include the `@requires_login` and `@requires_submission_perms` tags to the route definition. This tag adds a wrapper that checks if there exists a session for the current user and if the user is logged in, as well as checking the user's permissions to determine if the user has access to this route. If user is not logged in to the system or does not have access to the route, a 401 HTTP error will be returned. This tags are defined in `dataactbroker/permissions.py`.

`account_handler.py` contains the functions to check logins and to log users out.

`fileHandler.py` contains functions for managing user file interaction. It creates all of the jobs that are part of the user submission and has query methods to get the status of a submission. In addition, this class creates downloadable links to error reports created by the DATA Act Validator.

## DATA Act Broker Route Documentation

All routes that require a login should now be passed a header "x-session-id".  The value for this header should be taken
from the login route response header "x-session-id".

**All routes have an optional trailing slash, meaning the route will work with or without it.**

### Status Codes
In general, status codes returned are as follows:

* 200 if successful
* 400 if the request is malformed
* 401 if the username or password are incorrect, or the session has expired
* 500 for server-side errors

### GET "/"
This route confirms that the broker is running

Example input:

None

Example output:

"Broker is running"

### User Routes

#### POST "/v1/max_login/"
This route sends a request to the backend with the ticket obtained from the MAX login endpoint in order to verify authentication and access to the Data Broker. If called by a service account, a certificate is required for authentication. **IMPORTANT**: The ticket has a 30 second expiration window so it must be used immediately after being received in order for it to be valid.

#### Body (JSON)

```
{
    "ticket": "ST-123456-abcdefghijklmnopqrst-login.max.gov",
    "service": "https://broker-api.usaspending.gov"
}
```

#### Body Description

* `ticket` - ticket string received from MAX from initial login request (pending validation)
* `service` - URL encoded string that is the source of the initial login request. This may vary from the example based on the environment you are in.

#### Response (JSON)
Response will be somewhat similar to the original `/login` endpoint. More data will be added to the response depending on what we get back from MAX upon validating the ticket.

```

        }
    ],
    "session_id": "ABC123",

#### POST "/v1/login/"

### **THIS ENDPOINT IS FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY AND CANNOT BE USED TO AUTHENTICATE INTO BROKER IN PRODUCTION**

This route checks the username and password against a credentials file. It is used solely as a workaround for developing on a local instance of the broker to bypass MAX.gov login. Accepts input as json or form-urlencoded, with keys "username" and "password". See `current_user` docs for details.

Example input:

```json
{
    "username": "user",
    "password": "pass"
}
```

Example output:

```json
{
    "message": "Login successful",

    ],
    "session_id": "ABC123"
}
```

#### POST "/v1/logout/"
Logs the current user out, only the login route will be accessible until the next login.  If not logged in, just stays logged out. Returns 200 in both cases.

Example input:

None

Example output:

```json
{
    "message": "Logout successful"
}
```

#### GET "/v1/session/"
Checks that the session is still valid. Returns 200, and JSON with key "status" containing True if the session exists, and False if it doesn't.

Example input:

None

Example output:

```json
{
    "status": "True"
}
```

#### GET "/v1/current_user/"
Gets the information of the current that is login to the system.

Example input:

None

Example output:

```json

    ]
}
}
```

* `skip_guide` indicates whether or not the user has requested to skip introductory materials.
* `website_admin` describes a super-user status.
* `affiliations` is a list of objects indicating which agencies this user is a part of and what permissions they have at that agency.


#### POST "/v1/set_skip_guide/"
Sets skip_guide parameter for current user, which controls whether the submission guide should be displayed.  A call to this route should have JSON or form-urlencoded with key "skip_guide", value should be either true or false.

Example input:

```json
{
   "skip_guide": True
}
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "message": "skip_guide set successfully",
  "skip_guide": True
}
```

### File Routes

#### GET "/"
This route confirms that the broker is running

Example input: None
Example output: "Broker is running"

#### GET "/\<filename\>"
This path will return files located in the local folder. This path is only accessible for local installs due
to security reasons.

Example Route `/Users/serverdata/test.csv`  for example will return the `test.csv` if the local folder points
to `/Users/serverdata`.

#### POST "/v1/upload\_dabs\_files/"
A call to this route should be of content type `"multipart/form-data"`, and, if using curl or a similar service, should use @ notation for the values of the "appropriations", "program\_activity" and "award\_financial" keys, to indicate the local path to the files to be uploaded. Otherwise, should pass a file-like object.

This route will upload the files, then kick off the validation jobs. It will return the submission\_id.

For a new submission, all three files must be submitted. For corrections to an existing submission, one or more files must be submitted along with the `existing_submission_id` parameter.

## Automated Tests

Many of the broker tests involve interaction with a test database. However, these test databases are all created and 
torn down dynamically by the test framework, as new and isolated databases, so a live PostgreSQL server is all that's
needed.

These types of tests _should_ all be filed under the `data-act-broker-backend/tests/integration` folder, however the 
reality is that many of the tests filed under `data-act-broker-backend/tests/unit` also interact with a database. 

So first, ensure your `dataactcore/local_config.yml` and `dataactcore/local_secrets.yml` files are configured to be 
able to connect and authenticate to your local Postgres database server as instructed in [INSTALL.md](../doc/INSTALL.md) 

**To run _all_ tests**
```bash
$ pytest
```

**To run just _integration_ tests**
```bash
$ pytest tests/integration/*
```

**To run just _Broker API_ unit tests**
```bash
$ pytest tests/unit/dataactbroker/*
```

To generate a test coverage report with the run, just append the `--cov` flag to the `pytest` command.
