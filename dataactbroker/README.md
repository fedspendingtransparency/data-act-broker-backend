# The DATA Act Broker Application Programming Interface (API)

The DATA Act Broker API powers the DATA Act's data submission process.

## Background

The U.S. Department of the Treasury is building a suite of open-source tools to help federal agencies comply with the [DATA Act](http://fedspendingtransparency.github.io/about/ "Federal Spending Transparency Background") and to deliver the resulting standardized federal spending information back to agencies and to the public.

For more information about the DATA Act Broker codebase, please visit this repository's [main README](../README.md "DATA Act Broker Backend README").

## Broker API Project Layout

The Broker API has two major directories: scripts and handlers.

```
dataactbroker/
├── scripts/        (Install and setup scripts)
└── handlers/       (Route handlers)
```

### Scripts
The `/dataactbroker/scripts` folder contains the install scripts needed to setup the broker API for a local install. For complete instructions on running your own copy of the API and other DATA Act broker components, please refer to the [documentation in the DATA Act core responsitory](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-broker-backend/blob/master/doc/INSTALL.md "DATA Act broker installation guide").

### Handlers
The `dataactbroker/handlers` folder contains the logic to handle requests that are dispatched from the `domainRoutes.py`, `fileRoutes.py`, `loginRoutes.py`, and `userRoutes.py` files. Routes defined in these files may include the `@requires_login` and `@requires_submission_perms` tags to the route definition. This tag adds a wrapper that checks if there exists a session for the current user and if the user is logged in, as well as checking the user's permissions to determine if the user has access to this route. If user is not logged in to the system or does not have access to the route, a 401 HTTP error will be returned. This tags are defined in `dataactbroker/permissions.py`.

`account_handler.py` contains the functions to check logins and to log users out.

`fileHandler.py` contains functions for managing user file interaction. It creates all of the jobs that are part of the user submission and has query methods to get the status of a submission. In addition, this class creates downloadable links to error reports created by the DATA Act Validator.

## DATA Act Broker Route Documentation

All routes that require a login should now be passed a header "x-session-id".  The value for this header should be taken
from the login route response header "x-session-id".

### Status Codes
In general, status codes returned are as follows:

* 200 if successful
* 400 if the request is malformed
* 401 if the username or password are incorrect, or the session has expired
* 500 for server-side errors

### GET "/"
This route confirms that the broker is running

Example input:

None

Example output:

"Broker is running"

### User Routes

#### POST "/v1/max_login/"
This route sends a request to the backend with the ticket obtained from the MAX login endpoint in order to verify authentication and access to the Data Broker. If called by a service account, a certificate is required for authentication.

#### Body (JSON)

```
{
    "ticket": ST-123456-abcdefghijklmnopqrst-login.max.gov,
    "service": http%3A%2F%2Fbroker.usaspending.gov%2F
}
```

#### Body Description

* `ticket` - ticket string received from MAX from initial login request (pending validation)
* `service` - URL encoded string that is the source of the initial login request. This may vary from the example based on the environment you are in.

#### Response (JSON)
Response will be somewhat similar to the original `/login` endpoint. More data will be added to the response depending on what we get back from MAX upon validating the ticket.

## Test Cases

### Integration Tests

To run the broker API integration tests, navigate to the project's test folder (`data-act-broker-backend/tests`) and type the following:

        $ python integration/runTests.py

To generate a test coverage report from the command line:

1. Make sure you're in the project's test folder (`data-act-broker-backend/tests`).
2. Run the tests using the `coverage` command: `coverage run integration/runTests.py`.
3. After the tests are done running, view the coverage report by typing `coverage report`. To exclude third-party libraries from the report, you can tell it to ignore the `site-packages` folder: `coverage report --omit=*/site-packages*`.
