### Sample Data Act Broker Configuration ###
############################################


broker:

    # Specify the url where the front end of the application will be accessed.
    # For a local installation this will most likely be localhost or the 
    # location where the /public files are located. If a port is required, 
    # it should be appended to the URL.
    full_url: http://localhost:3000 


    # Set the key (string) used to serialize tokens for email validations.
    email_token_key: "1234"

    # Specify valid email address to be used as reply-to for
    # administrative emails sent by the broker.
    reply_to_email: valid.email@domain.com 

    # Set valid email address and password to be used as the DATA Act
    # broker's admin account. This is what you will use to log into
    # the broker website. The password should contain a combination
    # of letters, numbers, and special characters.
    admin_email: valid.email@domain.com
    admin_password: AdminP@ssw0rd!

    # The path where the broker will store submitted files and emails
    # when the broker is not using an AWS S3 bucket.
    # This should be an absolute path. Note that this path
    # is ignored if use_aws is true.
    broker_files: /full/path/to/broker/files


    ## AWS Configuration Settings ##

    # If set to true the application will use AWS for the storage of files 
    # submitted to the broker, to send e-mail, AND to access the dynamo db
    # for session handling.
    # Note that you must have the aws cli installed and credentials set in  
    # order to use AWS (see install instructions for more information).
    use_aws: false 

    # Name of AWS S3 bucket for uploaded broker files. Ignored if use_aws
    # is false. NOTE: the dummy value below MUST be changed to the correct
    # value if use_aws is true.
    aws_bucket: sample-aws-bucket-name
 
    # Name of the AWS role you're using to upload broker files. Ignored if
    # use_aws is false. NOTE: the dummy value below MUST be changed to the
    # correct value if use_aws is true.
    aws_role: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/roleName
 
    # Set the following to true to allow the broker to create temporary
    # AWS credentials for uploading files. Ignored if use_aws is false.
    aws_create_temp_credentials: true


services:
    # Set to true to turn on tracing rest errors.
    rest_trace: true

    # Set to true to turn on server debugging.
    server_debug: true

    # URL/IP address that hosts the broker API
    broker_api_host: 127.0.0.1
    broker_api_port: 3333

    # URL/IP address that hosts the validator API
    validator_host: 127.0.0.1
    validator_port: 3334

    # If you would like to restrict access from other origins, set the
    # allowed origins here. Otherwise, leave as '*'.
    cross_origin_url: '*'

    # The path where the broker will store error reports
    # generated by the validator. If you're running
    # everything on the same server, consider using the
    # same path as the broker_files setting (above)
    # for simplicity.
    # This should be an absolute path. Note that this path
    # is ignored if use_aws is true.
    error_report_path: /full/path/to/error/reports


db:
    # The name of your default postgres database. Unless you've exlicitly
    # changed this, you should not have to update the value below.
    base_db_name: postgres

    # Host and port of db instance. Set to localhost if running locally or set 
    # the remote address
    host: localhost
    port: 5432

    # Set your username and password for the db instance
    username: yourusername
    password: yourpassword

    # Set the names for each of the application databases
    base_db_name: postgres #This is the default db on the instance. 
    user_db_name: user_manager # User manager db
    job_db_name: job_tracker # Job tracker db
    staging_db_name: staging # Staging db
    validator_db_name: validation # Validation db
    error_db_name: error_data # Error data db

    # The broker uses DynamoDb for session management. If
    # use_aws is true above, the broker will use a
    # Dynamo instance on your AWS account. Otherwise,
    # provide a dynamo host and port below.
    dynamo_host: 127.0.0.1
    dynamo_port: 8000

logging:

    # The path where broker still store log files.
    # Ignored if use_logstash is true.
    log_files: /full/path/to/logfiles

    # Set following to true and fill in all logstash_ settings
    # to use logstash for logging
    use_logstash: false

    # Logstash host. Ignored if use_logstash is false.
    # NOTE: the dummy value below MUST be changed to the correct
    # value if use_logstash is true.
    logstash_host: logstash-host.compute-1.amazonaws.com

    # Logstash port. 514 is the port typically used with logstash,
    # so you can mostly likely keep this as is.
    logstash_port: 514
