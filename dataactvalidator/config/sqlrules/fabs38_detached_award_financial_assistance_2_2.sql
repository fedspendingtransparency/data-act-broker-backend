-- For new modifications to existing awards, we derive FundingOfficeCode from the original transaction establishing the
-- award, when it is provided there and not provided in the new modification. For this row, we are declining to derive
-- the FundingOfficeCode from the original transaction establishing the award because the FundingOfficeCode is not
-- specifically designated as an Assistance Funding Office. After June 2019, the Federal Hierarchy will require
-- distinction of the FundingOfficeCode as either a Procurement Funding Office or an Assistance Funding Office.
-- If the code is accurate, please update the Federal Hierarchy to include it. If it is not accurate, please correct
-- the original award transaction to reference a valid Financial Assistance AAC/office code in the hierarchy.
-- This validation rule does not apply to delete records (CorrectionDeleteIndicator = D).
