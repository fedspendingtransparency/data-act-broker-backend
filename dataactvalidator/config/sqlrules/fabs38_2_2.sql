-- For new modifications to existing awards, we derive FundingOfficeCode from the original transaction establishing the
-- award, when it is provided there and not provided in the new modification. For this row, we are declining to derive
-- the FundingOfficeCode from the original transaction establishing the award because the FundingOfficeCode is either
-- not listed in the Federal Hierarchy or not specifically designated an Assistance Funding Office. Since June 2019,
-- the Federal Hierarchy has required that FundingOfficeCodes be flagged as either a Procurement Funding Office or an
-- Assistance Funding Office (or both). If the code you are providing in this row is indeed accurate, please update the
-- Federal Hierarchy to include it and flag it as an Assistance Funding Office. If it is not accurate, please correct
-- the original award transaction to reference a valid Financial Assistance funding AAC/office code in the hierarchy.
