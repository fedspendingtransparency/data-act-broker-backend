-- When provided, FundingOfficeCode must be a valid value from the Federal Hierarchy, including being designated
-- specifically as an Assistance Funding Office in the hierarchy at the time the award was signed (per the Action Date).
-- Since June 2019, the Federal Hierarchy has required that FundingOfficeCodes be flagged as either a Procurement
-- Funding Office or an Assistance Funding Office (or both). The initial implementation of this distinction in FABS will
-- allow either type to be acceptable.
