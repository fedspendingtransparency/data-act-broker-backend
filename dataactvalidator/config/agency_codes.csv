DFC investments adhere to high standards and respect the environment, human rights, and worker rights.","On January 2nd, 2020, OPIC was replaced by DFC. In addition to absorbing OPIC, DFC also combined aspects of USAID,  including chiefly its Development Credit Authority (DCA). For DATA Act reporting purposes, the newly-created DFC continued to report as OPIC until its last submission in FY20Q4, but began to include the full set of DFC TAS in FY20Q3. DFC's first submission as DFC was in FY21Q1.",https://www.dfc.gov/,,,"Added entire row on 2/17. Going to cause a mess given that it subsumed OPIC, which has a different AID and SubTier. Will probably have to change OPIC's FREC CGAC Association flag etc and hardcode weird treatment of this to get it to show up right."
